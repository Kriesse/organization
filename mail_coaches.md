Dear Coaches,

Thanks so much for volunteering your time and enthusiasm to help coaching at the first ClojureBridge workshop in Berlin! 
You're awesome.

We count on everybody! All of you got attendees to teach.
If for any reason you can't attend the InstallFest or the Workshop, please let us know as soon as possible so we can adjust our plans accordingly. 
We have a full house of 35 attendees, so we need all your hands on deck to make this successful.


Here are a few things you should do this week to prepare for the workshop:
* Double-check the event times: 
==InstallFest Friday, July 10,  18:00 - 20:30 Vegan/vegetarian dinner and drinks provided. 

==Workshop Saturday, July 11, 9:00 - 18:00 Small breakfast & vegan/vegetarian lunch and drinks provided.
