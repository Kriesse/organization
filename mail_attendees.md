**Subject line: Welcome to the ClojureBridge Berlin Workshop!**


Dear ClojureBridge attendees,

We are so excited too see you at the ClojureBridge workshop July 10-11.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:

* Registration for this workshop is capped at 30 participants, and we do have a waiting list. 
Please let us know if you can't attend this workshop, so we can offer your spot to someone on the waiting list.

* Attendance at the Friday night InstallFest is mandatory. 
We'll be installing all the necessary software on your laptop so you'll be ready to go Saturday morning. 
And it'll be fun, we promise. You'll get to meet the other workshop participants and coaches. 
We'll have free vegan/vegetarian food and drinks available.

* Some breakfast snacks and vegan/vegetarian lunch are provided on Saturday. 
If you'd like to bring your own food, you're welcome to do so. 
We'll have a fridge, dishes & eating utensils on hand.

* The location is:
6 Wunderkinder office, GmbH Karl-Liebknecht-Stra√üe 32, 10178 Berlin 
Attached you find a picture of the venue entrance. 
Due to security reasons we need to shuttle all attendees from the groundfloor to the 7th floor.
We will try to make this as fast and comfortable as possible for you.
There will be a phone number downstairs on a poster to call us if you have questions.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, please contact us at clojurebridge.berlin@gmail.com

We can't wait to meet you!
